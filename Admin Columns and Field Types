I am not sure if this is the correct way to submit a suggestion... I'm new at this. But I have noticed several things that would make JetEngine the BEST!! And even better than
ACF PRO! I would like to be able to add taxonomy meta fields to the admin columns as well so that if I have images for a taxonomy, I can choose to show that in the taxonomy
admin table. Also, I'm a little frustrated that I have to use both ACF fields and JetEngine fields and it gets a little confusing at times during template setup, because we 
don't have enough field types to match the most used field types. BTW, THANK YOU for the repeater field!!! Speaking of repeater field, I would like to still be able to set 
limits on the amount of characters that can be added in the repeater sub fields. Those are not present on the sub fields. :( And, it would be awesome to have a Google Map field, 
a URL field (for validation and ease), an email field, a star rating field (for reviews), an oembed field, and the option in the WYSIWYG field to hide or show both visual and text
and to set basic or full toolbar on it. :) Thanks for all of your hard work! I LOVE LOVE LOVE your plugin!!
